## How the mod works

The mod adjusts the game logic to minimize instances where citizens become permanently homeless.

There are bugs in the game:
- Only a specific group of citizens (always the same ones) can look for houses. If this group can't find housing, the others never get a chance, resulting them forever stuck on the streets.
- (Before 1.2.0f1) Although parks have a set homeless capacity, they can actually hold an unlimited number of homeless citizens.
- Campers can stay in the parks as long as they wish.

For first-time installations or if you suspect problems with homelessness later on, use the remove-homeless buttons in the settings to clear homeless citizens.
